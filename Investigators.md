The Elders
----------

_These two characters are so heavily entangled
with the background and the mystery of the scenario
that it would be very hard,
if not even nearly impossible,
to replace them with custom Investigators_

The Orphans
-----------

_The six of seven former children
in the orphanage of Gdańsk Wrzeszcz,
who swore to reunite again when they are adults_

_These characters can actually be replaced with custom Investigators,
under the constraints that they are still among
those six of former seven children of the orphange,
and that their parents deceased during or shortly after World War II_

_In the above case,
the Keeper should invent a link between their parents
and the mystery of the scenario
based on the players' FlashBack memories
during the first scene "On the Beach" of Act #Zero_
