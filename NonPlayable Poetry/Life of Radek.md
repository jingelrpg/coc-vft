Life of Radek
=============

_The poem that layed most of the foundation
for the [**Call of Cthulhu** RolePlaying](
  https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/) scenario
"Voices from Torpedownia"_

_It should only be read after
having played Investigator Radek at least once,
or in the case of never intending to do so.
It might otherwise limit the players' imagination_

Fog comes crawling from the sea, <br>
Carried by the waves <br>
In subtle harmony, <br>
Waging forth and back with them so tightly bound <br>
That even softer is the seaside's meditative sound

The water put itself inside a cloak, <br>
As if it was ashamed <br>
Of what there might be seen inside <br>
While brightly shining in the full moon's light <br>
Of this warm and silent summer night <br>
At Babie Doły beach

Together with that film of water <br>
Left behind at land <br>
With every wave <br>
That reaches far into the fine white sand, <br>
The fog drains steadily into the ground, <br>
Inside it spreads and reaches out, <br>
Fills up each tiny gap of air <br>
And charms the feet of those <br>
Who came this night right there

They came to breath in the mild salty breeze, <br>
To get lost in stars like millionfold seeds <br>
Of pleasure, joy, and confidence <br>
Above a sky so clear <br>
That nowhere it starts <br>
And nowhere it ends

The fog around the group of young friends <br>
Now turns the sand into a second sea, <br>
Not liquid but as soft as made of cotton flowers <br>
Covering an endless cloth of silk invisibly

Watching from a bench <br>
The pleasure of the youth down there, <br>
That celebrates a life no more aware <br>
Of neither war nor other threads <br>
Of unimaginable qualities, <br>
Burried aching memories <br>
Of loss and oh! this one eternal fright <br>
Revived in old man Radek's soul this night

His mind had rarely left that battlefield <br>
Where he was running from the toxic gas <br>
Released there by the enemies

Barely shielded by his old and clumsy mask, <br>
He stumbled over corpses <br>
Ripped open and apart, <br>
Half stuck in the muddy work of terror's art <br>
Like stumps of dead old trees. <br>
Some gave birth to filthy creatures <br>
Crawling through their skulls, <br>
Their chests, <br>
The earth beneath

Falling straight into a rifle bound <br>
To strong cramped fingers <br>
Sticking out of blood- and tear-soaked ground, <br>
The bayonet stabbed from the bottom through his mask within, <br>
Cut slightly into eyebrow, cheek, and chin, <br>
So that all within <br>
His sight <br>
Lost any meaning <br>
In that freezing winter night

All vanished but the edge <br>
Of the weapon so close to his eye, <br>
No more bullets flying by, <br>
No more screaming, <br>
Detonations, <br>
Roaring sounds of war machines, <br>
No more madmen <br>
Living out the Devil's wildest dreams. <br>

No more enemies were there, <br>
No more gas smell in the air. <br>
After freeing carefully his head <br>
From its ironic trap, <br>
He suddenly became aware <br>
That indeed no gas <br>
Was left around him anywhere, <br>
That a silence had set in <br>
He hadn't known for years <br>

He seemed to be the only living soul around, <br>
when suddenly a deep and heavy <br>
All-enclosing sound <br>
Came crawling into his from battle noise recovering ears

Looking back at the enemy line, <br>
He suddenly felt all the fears, <br>
All grief <br>
Of his entire life <br>
Becoming obsolete <br>
Compared to sudden pure and total fright <br>
Instilled in him by what he clearly could perceive <br>
Now in his whole life's darkest night

Remaining clouds of gas were soaked into the ground, <br>
Human lifeless bodies started flying up and down, <br>
Rushing through each other <br>
Like the leafs of trees in heavy storm, <br>
Held by countless arms <br>
Of a creature that could have not been born <br>
Beneath this starless cloudy new moon sky

Saturated with its prey, <br>
The creature vanished in darkness away, <br>
Leaving him alone yet not to die, <br>
Not knowing should he cherish his survival <br>
Or forever cry

The horror was gone and soon the war, <br>
He went back home but nothing was there anymore. <br>
His home, his parents' house, it lay in ruins, <br>
No neighbor could tell him where his parents' grave is. <br>
He went on to get drunk with all he could find, <br>
A miracle was that he did not get blind

For many months he just felt torn, <br>
Until one day he got aware <br>
That a country was reborn <br>
And needed his skills, <br>
His talents in crafts, his will <br>
To rebuild a prosperous Polish society <br>
Which could only succeed <br>
With a wholly new port to the Baltic Sea

He left all behind, he straightly moved there <br>
Where he worked like a soulless machine, <br>
Until love approached him from shiny green eyes, <br>
From lips as sweet as a tangerine, <br>
From soft cheeks and chin, <br>
From a huge smile in between

She gifted him joy, two sons, a daughter, <br>
An adorable family, <br>
Leaving less and less space <br>
For visions of horror and agony <br>
In his closed eyes' sight <br>

The horror which had followed him night by night, <br>
It vanished, became an old dream, <br>
A scene from a movie <br>
He might or might not have seen

As years went by, the war came again, <br>
Not the war that he knew, <br>
A war much faster and crueler, <br>
With millionfold sin. <br>
It brought even deadlier war machines, <br>
Which not even the Devil <br>
Could think of in his wildest dreams <br>

They took on the battlefield the live of one son. <br>
They took on retreat the life of the other one. <br>
They took so close to their home <br>
The lives of his wife and his daughter on the run, <br>
So close to his eyes <br>
That all mercy in Radek was gone

He joined the resistance, _\[TODO\]_ ...

_\[TODO\]_ ...
