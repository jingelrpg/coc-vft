Voices from Torpedownia
=======================

> **Location:** The Polish town Gdynia at the Baltic Sea

Introduction
------------

Fog comes crawling from the sea,
carried by the waves,
waging forth and back with them so tightly bound
that barely can be heard the seaside's meditative sound,
as if the water put itself inside a cloak,
as if the water was ashamed of what there might be seen inside
while brightly shining in the full moon's light
of this warm and silent summer night at Or≈Çowo beach.

Together with the film of water left behind at land
with every wave that reaches far into the fine white sand,
the fog drains steadily into the ground,
inside it spreads and reaches out,
filling up each tiny gap of air,
charming the feet of those who came this night right there
to breath the breeze ,
to breath in stars down from a sky exceptionally clear,
now feeling like walking in a second sea,
a sea not liquid but as soft as made of cotton flowers
covering an endless cloth of silk invisibly.

It seems like all the pleasure of the youth down there,
celebrating life that is no more aware
of neither war nor other threads of unimaginable quality,
accumulates in aching memories of loss and fear
in old man Radek's soul,
a soul which never left the battlefield,
which still tries to run away from tons of toxic gas
released there by the enemies,
barely protected by his mask that broke when he stumbled over corpses,
half stuck in the muddy ground like stumps of dead old trees.

Falling straight into a rifle bound
to strong cramped fingers sticking out of blood-soaked ground,
the bayonet stabbed from the bottom through his mask,
cut slightly into eyebrow, cheek, and chin,
so that all within his sight
lost any meaning in that long-gone freezing winter night,
all but the edge of the weapon so close to his eye,
no more bullets flying by,
no more screaming, detonations, roaring sounds of war machines,
no more madmen living out the devil's wildest dreams.

No more enemies were there,
no more gas smell in the air,
and after freeing carefully his head from its ironic trap,
he became aware that indeed no gas was left around him anywhere,
that silence had set in,
that he seemed to be the only living soul around,
when suddenly a deep and heavy all-enclosing sound
came crawling into his from battle noise recovering ears,
looking back at the enemy line,
he suddenly felt all the fears of his entire life
becoming obsolete compared to sudden pure and total fright
instilled into him by what he barely could perceive
in his whole life's darkest night.

Remaining clouds of gas were soaked into the ground,
human lifeless bodies flying up and down,
rushing through each other like the leafs of trees in heavy storm,
held by countless arms of a creature that could have not been born
beneath this starless cloudy new moon sky,
...
