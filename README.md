Voices from Torpedownia
=======================

_A scenario for the [**Call of Cthulhu** Role-Playing](
  https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/) system,
wherein sanity becomes the currency
for re-acquiring never processed parts of memory_

_When all ghosts from the past,
that had made life unbearable for so long,
that were locked up to move on,
need to be faced at once
to stop a neverending vicious dance_

_When centuries of studies
of the laws of the ever-repeating history,
to find the key of freedom for a nation and its society,
lead to nothing but ever-repeating sacrifice and cruelty_

Act #Zero :: The Night the Time Runs Back and Forth
---------------------------------------------------

_"Voices from Torpedownia"
is not a classic time-travelling adventure,
actually none at all,
and yet the Investigators go on a journey through memories
that heavily influences their present activities,
memories spanning three decades,
from a toxic gas-soaked battlefield of World War I
to the years just after World War II had finally gone_

### On the Beach

It is the summer of 1962.
The Baltic Sea is warm and quiet
just like the clear and shiny full-moon night.
They are united again!
At least six of those formerly unseparatable seven children
in the orphanage of Gdańsk Wrzeszcz,
children whose parents all died or went missing
during and soon after the war

They had always caused trouble at the orphange,
which often had painful consequences,
but they just wanted to stick together
and tried whatever possible
to avoid being given away to new families,
until they were separated in the orphanage
and finally gave up their resistance

Now they are young adults and managed to fulfill
what they swore to each other in the orphanage,
getting together again when they would be old enough
to go their own ways in life.
All came together except...
None of them could find out anything so far
about what happened to their friend

But the Six of Seven will not give up!
And tonight they want to celebrate
what they achieved so far,
here at Babie Doły beach in the north and almost outside of Gdynia,
where they are alone and can talk freely
in times when you always have to be a bit careful
what you are talking about
and who might be listening

> The players choose
> whom of the Orphans to impersonate.
> At least one and not more than two of the Six of Seven
> should be chosen as Investigators,
> and two players need to be left
> for impersonating the Elder Investigators,
> which are introduced in the next two scenes of this act
>
> For making that decision,
> the players should basically ask themselves
> if they want to play young Investigators
> who had no active personal involvement
> in the mystery behind the adventure so far,
> but will find out step by step about the involvements
> of their real parents,
> or if they want to play elderly characters
> whose life is directly entangled with the mystery,
> even though they don't know yet
>
> If the players can't decide for specific characters,
> then dice are used.
> In the Investigator descriptions,
> the Orphans are numbered from 1 to 6.
> Every player basically interested
> in impersonating one of the Six of Seven
> rolls 1D6.
> The player(s) with the lowest number(s)
> choose the according Invenstigator(s).
> If there are equal numbers among them,
> all players that qualified that way roll again.
> This is repeated until a clear result is achieved
>
> The players talk about stories from the orphanage,
> from all the time their Investigators were separated,
> and about how they managed to find each other again.
> The Keeper takes over the role(s)
> of as many of the remaining Six of Seven as they want
> during this conversation
> and makes notes about those stories
> to use them later during the adventure
> whenever possible
> (More information on how to use those notes is given
> in the **Keeper Knowledge** appendices)

Suddenly the sound of the sea changes.
It gets much softer and even quieter.
The continuous sounds of the waves start to reverb.
Looking at the sea,
the Orphans see the water slowly getting blurry.
Then a thick and smooth white fog
is emitted from the water surface
and covers it so tightly
that it follows every movement of the water, every wave

The fog flows back and forth with the waves
when they hit the beach,
but every time a bit more of the fog stays on land
and drains down into the sand.
The Six of Seven feel the sand below their feet
becoming slowly softer.
They feel like walking on finest pillows,
or like in a sea of blossoms from unknown flowers

Each of the Orphans starts to realize
that this is not the first time,
that every one of the Six of Seven has seen that fog before,
when they were very young,
when their parents were still alive.
They realize that it was no dream
as they had thought for all those years,
and they start to remember...

> At this point, the Keeper explains the so-called
> **Flash-Back Mechanics (FBM)** of this adventure,
> in which sanity checks decide
> how much of the essential memories
> for understanding and solving the mystery behind the adventure
> is revealed by the Keeper in those Flash-Backs.
> The more sanity is lost,
> the more is revealed.
> The player(s) also tell about
> their own aspects of those memories.
> The Keeper makes again notes about these
> to use them later during the adventure
> whenever possible

### On the Bench

Behind the beach sits Radek on a bench,
watching and listening to the sea.
He often comes here,
thinking about his life,
all his engagement for good and noble
but also many doubtful and useless causes,
all his failures,
all the losses

Usually the beach is empty at night.
The Six of Seven make him think a lot
about his own youth this time,
and when he sees the fog appearing,
all his mind goes straightly back
to that night on the battlefield
not far away from his home village near Krakow,
just before World War I came to an end in Eastern Europe

Radek and the other remaining soldiers
in that small unit of the Russian Army
had already been back home in their minds
when the Germans suddenly attacked a last time,
releasing all their remaining toxic gas supplies
into the strong wind that carried them rapidly into the Russian lines.
Having almost no functioning gas masks left,
the Polish and Russian soldiers could do nothing else but run,
and one after the other was horribly humilated
by German machine guns from behind...

> The Keeper asks what Radek thought about
> when running for his life,
> when seeing one after the other friendly soldier dying around him,
> including friends from his childhood,
> and what are the most remarkable cruelties he has seen
>
> The remaining two players decide who wants to impersonate him,
> and who wants to impersonate the last remaining Investigator Jelka,
> whose story begins in the Free City of Gdańsk in the 1920s,
> and who is introduced in the next scene
>
> Investigator Radek's player answers the Keeper's questions,
> and the Keeper makes like before notes of those details
> to use them later in the adventure whenever possible

### Meanwhile in the Hospital

Jelka is late.
Inspection of the cargo ship coming back from Sweden
to the harbor of Gansk
took longer than usual today.
Luckily they weren't specifically searching for the medicines.
They just wanted to frighten the sailors a bit
to make them think twice
before trying to smuggle anything subversive from the West into Poland,
anything that could show deficits in the country's
badly planned centralized economy

She has the antibiotics with her,
and some of the latest anaesthetics
that make surgeries much safer for the patients.
On her way to the office of Dr. Szwedowski,
she suddenly hears a somehow familiar voice,
only sounding much scratchier
than the last time she heard it,
and filled with a lot of pain

A door to a patients room is left open.
She steps quietly inside and sees an old man
...

> The Keeper can also take over the role(s) of some of them

### The Creature Returns

At Babie Doły beach the situation worsens.
The Flash-Backs of the Orphans had put them into a short state of apathy,
which now turns into deep concerns about what will happen next.
They want to leave the beach,
but in that very moment sand and fog
shoot up from the ground around them,
and giant arms appear,
tentacles that immediately grab all Six of Seven
and drag them towards the sea

> Seeing this, Radek has the final Flash-Back from the battlefield.
> The Keeper tells him what suddenly ended the battle,
> what happened to the German soldiers,
> what had left him all alone there,
> what actually caused his survival,
> but also his lofe-long nightmares

Radek doesn't think long about what to do.
He doesn't want to witness another tragic loss of people.
Death had followed him so closely and greedily through his life
that he is not afraid of taking the risk of dying himself.
He runs to the beach to try saving the Orphans somehow...
