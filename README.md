PROLOGUE
--------

Fog comes crawling from the sea,
carried by the waves,
waging forth and back with them so tightly bound
that barely can be heard the seaside's meditative sound.
The water put itself inside a cloak,
as if it was ashamed of what there might be seen inside
while brightly shining in the full moon's light
of this warm and silent summer night
at Babie Doły beach.

Together with this film of water left behind at land
with every wave that reaches far into the fine white sand,
the fog drains steadily into the ground.
Inside it spreads and reaches out,
fills up each tiny gap of air,
and charms the feet of those who came this night right there.

They came to breath in the mild salty breeze,
to get lost in stars like millionfold seeds
of joy and confidence
above a sky so clear that nowhere it starts and nowhere it ends.
The sand below the group of young friends
had turned into a second sea,
not liquid but as soft as made of cotton flowers
covering an endless cloth of silk invisibly.

Watching from a bench the pleasure of the youth down there,
that celebrates a life no more aware
of neither war nor other threads of unimaginable quality,
aching memories of loss and oh! this one eternal fright
crawled back in old man Radek's soul this night.

His mind has rarely left that battlefield,
where he was running from the toxic gas
released there by the enemies.
Barely shielded by his old and clumsy mask,
he stumbled over corpses ripped open and apart
and half stuck in the muddy work of terror's art
like stumps of dead old trees.
Some gave birth to filthy creatures
crawling through their skulls and chests and earth beneath.

Falling straight into a rifle bound
to strong cramped fingers sticking out of blood- and tear-soaked ground,
the bayonet stabbed from the bottom through his mask.
It cut slightly into eyebrow, cheek, and chin,
so that all within
his sight
lost any meaning in that freezing winter night.
All vanished but the edge of the weapon so close to his eye,
no more bullets flying by,
no more screaming, detonations, roaring sounds of war machines,
no more madmen living out the devil's wildest dreams.

No more enemies were there,
no more gas smell in the air.
After freeing carefully his head from its ironic trap,
he became aware
that indeed no gas was left around him anywhere,
that a silence had set in he hadn't known for years.
He seemed to be the only living soul around,
when suddenly a deep and heavy all-enclosing sound
came crawling into his from battle noise recovering ears.

Looking back at the enemy line,
he suddenly felt all the fears, all grief
of his entire life
becoming obsolete compared to sudden pure and total fright
instilled in him by what he barely could perceive
now in his whole life's darkest night.

Remaining clouds of gas were soaked into the ground.
Human lifeless bodies started flying up and down,
rushing through each other like the leafs of trees in heavy storm,
held by countless arms of a giant creature that could have not been born
beneath this starless cloudy new moon sky.
Saturated with its prey,
the creature vanished in darkness away,
leaving him alone yet not to die,
not knowing should he cherish his survival or forever cry.

The horror was gone and soon the war,
he went back home but nothing was there anymore.
His home, his parents' house, it lay in ruins,
no neighbor could tell him where his parents' grave is.
He went on to get drunk with all he could find,
a miracle was that he did not get blind.

For many months he just felt torn,
until one day he got aware
that a country was reborn
and needed his skills,
his talents in crafts, his will
to rebuild a prosperous Polish society
which could only succeed
with a wholly new port to the Baltic Sea.

He left all behind, he straightly moved there,
where he worked like a soulless machine,
until love approached him from shiny green eyes,
from lips as sweet as a tangerine,
from soft cheeks and chin,
from a huge smile in between.

She gifted him joy, two sons, a daughter, an adorable family,
leaving less and less space for visions of horror and agony
in his closed eyes' sight.
That horror which had followed him night by night,
it vanished, became an old dream,
a scene from a movie he might or might not have seen.

As years went by, the war came again,
not the war that he knew,
a war even faster and crueler,
with millionfold sin.
It brought even deadlier war machines,
which not even the devil could think of in wildest dreams.
They took on the battlefield the live of one son.
They took on retreat the life of the other one.
They took so close to their home
the lives of his wife and his daughter on the run,
so close to his eyes,
that all mercy in Radek was gone.

INVESTIGATORS
-------------

> ***Radosław*** **'Radek'** ***Szulc***

* A retired World War I veteran from a small village near Kraków (Cracow),
  who was forced as a young man to join the Russian army.
  He was the only survivor on an unspecified minor battlefield
  in the end phase of the war in Eastern Europe.
  During an exceptionally dark night,
  all other soldiers on Russian side were killed
  by German artillery and a gas attack.
  While Radek tried to escape the battlefield,
  suddenly all gas got strangely soaked up by the ground
  and all German soldiers got mysteriously killed and taken away
  by a giant alien creature,
  which left recurring horror visions in Radek's mind
  for most of his life.
* After finding out that he lost his parents to the war when coming home,
  Radek soon moved to Gdynia to help building the new Polish Baltic Sea port,
  started a family and stayed there.
* Radek joined the Polish resistance in World War II after having lost
  his wife and all his three children to the war.
  There he met Jelka, a young woman with exceptional intellect
  and huge knowledge in chemistry,
  which had made her become an explosives specialist.
  Soon after she joined his resistance group
  they got attacked one night by Gestapo.
  Radek was drunk and therefore didn't see them coming.
  Only Jelka and Radek survived
  but couldn't deal each with other anymore
  due to his lethal failure.
* Radek is a man of action, who is almost fearless after having endured
  an unimaginable fright when whitnessing
  the horrifying incident on the battlefield.
  But he got lazy in his old days due to the increasing amount of alcohol
  he consumes to drown his torturing emotions
  about the cruel deaths of all his loved ones and fellows in his life.
* Radek is very skilled and telented in various handcrafts,
  able to repair virtually any machine and to improve tools and vehicles
  for special purposes.
* Now an old and desperate man,
  Radek whitnesses the alien creature coming back
  to snatch away a group of young people into the Baltic Sea at night.
  He is able to save young woman Gosia during the incident.
  After a few days of almost unbearable horror visions
  he agrees to Gosia's plan of investigating
  what is going on in the abandoned military sea platform Torpedownia,
  from where she heard the voices of her friends when revisiting the beach.

> ***Małgorzata*** **'Gosia'** _\[TODO\]_ ...

* A medicine student from Gdynia,
  who is the only one of a group of young people
  that can be saved by Radek
  when he whitnesses the group getting mysteriously dragged
  by an alien creature into the Baltic Sea
  during the night at Babie Doły beach.
* Gosia lost her mother during a similar event when she was a child
  and alone with her at Orłowo beach at night,
  happy that the war was over,
  cherishing their survival and their hope for a better future.
  She saw a cat and wanted to play with it.
  When she ran after the cat and a little away from the beach,
  the same fog suddenly appeared.
  Her mother was as fascinated as Gosia's present friends
  by the strange event
  and was eventually also dragged into the sea like them.
  Nodoby wanted to believe Gosia's story about what she had seen.
  The event was offically declared as a suicide by the police.
  Gosia grew up alone then with her father,
  and as the years went by, the memories of her mother
  and the tragedy of her mother's disappearance
  became more and more just nothing but an old childhood dream.
* Gosia is a brave young woman with straight goals her life.
  She has already lots of practical experience as a physician assistant,
  is therefore able to treat many injuries,
  and has a good sense for recognizing probable threats to health.
* After the incident of her stolen friends,
  all memories about her mother come back.
  Gosia realizes that it was caused by the same mysterious force.
  She decides to fight back.
  After a few days she returns to Babie Doły beach at night
  and suddenly hears the voices of her friends,
  seeming to come from Torpedownia.
  She convinces Radek to investigate the incident together with her
  and reveal the mystery about what is going on
  in the abandoned military sea platform.

> ***Angelika*** **'Jelka'** ***Bronsztajn***

* The head of a smuggling organization in Gdańsk,
  which secretly imports Swedish medicines to Poland,
  where health-care is badly organized
  and has to struggle with constant shortages in medication supply
  from the Soviet Union.
  The smuggle is supported by Jelka's Jewish contacts
  in the Swedish pharmaceutical industry.
* Jelka has a very broad knowledge and speeks several languages,
  which she learned from her father,
  a Jewish Austro-Slovakian World War I deserter from Bratislava,
  who was a pharmacist, anarchist, and member of the Esperanto movement.
  On his escape from the Austrian army jurisdiction,
  he eventually found shelter in the Jewish community
  of the Free City of Gdańsk,
  where he met Jelka's mother
  and took the opportunity to run a pharmacy
  after the retirement of its former owner
  and fellow Jewish community member.
* During the Nazi occupation of Gdańsk,
  Jelka and her father found shelter in different Jewish-friendly families,
  until her father was eventually arrested by Gestapo.
  Luckily she wasn't found and continued to find several hideouts.
* In the middle of World War II,
  Jelka joined the Polish resistance,
  where she used the chemical knowledge she gained from her father
  to become an explosives specialist.
  After becoming a member of Radek's resistance group,
  she quickly fell in love with him,
  but was soon afterwards besides Radek the only survivor
  of an attack on the group
  that Radek had not seen coming due to being drunk.
* Jelka still loves Radek,
  but could never forgive him the loss of their resistance group members.
  Therefore they haven't seen or talked to each other for a long time.
  Now Radek asks her to join the investigation of Torpedownia,
  because he feels that she is the only one
  who might believe him what happened to the young people at the beach.
  He also hopes that she will realize how much he truly regrets
  his failures of the past,
  and that he seeks a final salvation
  by rescuing those stolen young people
  and facing the mysterious forces
  that have haunted him in his dreams for most of his life.
