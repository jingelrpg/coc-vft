INTRODUCTION
------------

Fog comes crawling from the sea,
carried by the waves,
waging forth and back with them so tightly bound
that barely can be heard the seaside's meditative sound,
as if the water put itself inside a cloak,
as if the water was ashamed of what there might be seen inside
while brightly shining in the full moon's light
of this warm and silent summer night at Orłowo beach.

Together with the film of water left behind at land
with every wave that reaches far into the fine white sand,
the fog drains steadily into the ground,
inside it spreads and reaches out,
filling up each tiny gap of air,
charming the feet of those who came this night right there
to breath the _\[TODO\]_ ... breeze,
to breath in stars down from a sky exceptionally clear,
now feeling like walking in a second sea,
a sea not liquid but as soft as made of cotton flowers
covering an endless cloth of silk invisibly.

It seems like all the pleasure of the youth down there,
celebrating life that is no more aware
of neither war nor other threads of unimaginable quality,
accumulates in aching memories of loss and fear
in old man Radek's soul,
a soul which never left the battlefield,
which still tries to run away from tons of toxic gas
released there by the enemies,
barely protected by his mask that broke when he stumbled over corpses,
half stuck in the muddy ground like stumps of dead old trees.

Falling straight into a rifle bound
to strong cramped fingers sticking out of blood-soaked ground,
the bayonet stabbed from the bottom through his mask,
cut slightly into eyebrow, cheek, and chin,
so that all within his sight
lost any meaning in that long-gone freezing winter night,
all but the edge of the weapon so close to his eye,
no more bullets flying by,
no more screaming, detonations, roaring sounds of war machines,
no more madmen living out the devil's wildest dreams.

No more enemies were there,
no more gas smell in the air,
and after freeing carefully his head from its ironic trap,
he became aware that indeed no gas was left around him anywhere,
that silence had set in,
that he seemed to be the only living soul around,
when suddenly a deep and heavy all-enclosing sound
came crawling into his from battle noise recovering ears,
looking back at the enemy line,
he suddenly felt all the fears of his entire life
becoming obsolete compared to sudden pure and total fright
instilled into him by what he barely could perceive now
in his whole life's darkest night.

Remaining clouds of gas were soaked into the ground,
human lifeless bodies flying up and down,
rushing through each other like the leafs of trees in heavy storm,
held by countless arms of a giant creature that could have not been born
beneath this starless cloudy new moon sky,
then slowly _\[TODO\]_ ...

The horror was gone and soon the war,
a country was reborn and needed his skills, his talents in crafts,
his will to rebuild a prosperous Polish society,
love approached him from shiny green eyes
and gifted him joy, two sons, one daughter, an adorable family,
leaving less and less space for visions of horror in his closed eyes' sight,
horror that had followed him night by night
now vanished away, became an old dream from _\[TODO\]_ ...

As years went by the war came again,

INVESTIGATORS
-------------

> ***Radosław*** **'Radek'** ***Szulc***

* A retired World War I veteran from a small village near Kraków (Cracow),
  who was forced as a young man to fight for the Russian army
  and was one of the few survivors on an unspecified minor battle field
  in the end phase of the war in Eastern Europe,
  after all soldiers on the Russian side were killed
  by German artillery and a gas attack,
  followed by all gas getting strangely soaked up by the ground
  and all German soldiers getting mysteriously killed
  and taken away during an exceptionally dark night
  by a giant alien creature,
  which left recurring horror visions in Radek's mind
  for most of his life.
* A man of action, who is almost fearless after having endured
  an unimaginable fright when whitnessing
  the supernatural incident on the battle field,
  but got lazy in his old days due to alcohol,
  which he drinks more and more to drown his torturing emotions
  about the losses of all the loved ones in his life.
* After having lost his parents to the war at home,
  he moved to Gdynia after the war
  to help building the new Baltic Sea port,
  started a family and stayed there.
* Joined the Polish resistance in World War II after having lost
  his wife and all his children to the war.
* Very skilled and telented in various handcrafts,
  able to repair virtually any machine.
* Wants to find out what's going on in the Torpedownia sea platform
  after being told about voices of the stolen young poeple
  can be heard from there at night.

> ***Małgorzata*** **'Gosia'** _\[TODO\]_ ...

* A medicine student from Gdynia,
  who is the only one of a group of young people
  that can be saved by Radek,
  who whitnesses the group getting mysteriously snatched away
  by an alien creature into the Baltic Sea
  during the night at Orłowo beach.
* Convinces Radek to investigate the incident of her stolen friends together
  and find out what's going on in the Torpedownia sea platform
  after hearing voices of her friends from there at night
  when revisiting the beach.
* Has already lots of practical experience as a physician assistant,
  is therefore able to treat many injuries,
  and has a good sense for approaching health threats.

> _\[TODO\]_ ...

* A retired pharmacy owner from Gdańsk,
  who used the chemical knowledge she gained from her father,
  the former owner of the pharmacy,
  to become an explosives specialist in Radek's resistance group
  during World War II, where she was the only survivor besides him
  after an attack on the group that Radek had not seen coming
  due to being drunk.
* Loves Radek, but could never forgive him
  the loss of their resistance group members,
  so they haven't seen or talked to each other for a long time.
* Asked by Radek to join the investigation of Torpedownia,
  since he knows she is the only one
  who might believe him what happened to the young people at the beach.
