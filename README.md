Voices from Torpedownia
=======================

_A scenario for the [**Call of Cthulhu** RolePlaying](
  https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/) system,
wherein sanity becomes the currency
for re-acquiring never processed parts of memory_

_When all ghosts from the past,
that had made life unbearable for so long,
that were locked up to move on,
need to be faced at once
to stop a neverending vicious dance_

_When centuries of studies
of the laws of the ever-repeating history,
to find the key of freedom for a nation and its society,
lead to nothing but ever-repeating sacrifice and gruelty_

Act #Zero :: The Night the Time Runs Back and Forth
---------------------------------------------------

_"Voices from Torpedownia"
is not a classic time-travelling adventure,
actually none at all.
And yet the Investigators go on a journey through memories
that heavily influences their present activities,
memories spanning three decades,
from a toxic gas-soaked battlefield of World War I
to the years just after World War II had finally gone_

### On the Beach

It is the summer of 1961.
The Baltic Sea is warm and quiet
just like the clear and shiny full-moon night.
They are almost all united again,
six of those unseparatable seven former children
in the orphanage of Gdańsk Wrzeszcz,
children whose parents all died or went missing
during and soon after the war

They had always caused trouble at the orphange,
which often had painful consequences,
but they just wanted to stick together
and tried whatever possible
to avoid being given away to new families.
Until they were separated at the orphanage
and finally gave up their resistance

Now they are young adults and managed to fulfill
what they swore together in the orphanage,
finding each other again when they are old enough
to go their own ways in life.
All came together except Tomek.
None of the others could find out anything so far
about what happened to him

But they would never give up,
and tonight they want to celebrate
what they achieved so far,
here at Babie Doły beach in the far north of Gdynia,
where they are alone and can talk freely
in times when you always have to be a bit careful
what you are talking about

> The players now choose
> whom of those characters to impersonate.
> At least one and not more than two of the Orphans
> should be chosen as Investigators,
> and two players need to be left
> for impersonating the following two Investigator characters,
> which are about to be introduced
> in the next two scenes of this act
>
> For making this decision,
> the players should basically ask themselves
> if they want to play young Investigators
> who have no personal involvement
> in the mystery behind the adventure
> (whereby their real parents
> were actually involved to varying degrees),
> or if they want to play elderly characters
> whose past is directly entangled with the mystery,
> even though they don't know yet
>
> If the players can't decide for specific characters,
> then dice can be used.
> In the Investigator descriptions,
> the Orphans are numbered from 1 to 6.
> Roll 1D6 for choosing the first one.
> Then the optional second player rolls 1D6 again
> until they roll a number different from the first one
> for choosing the second one
>
> Afterwards the players should talk about stories
> from the orphanage,
> from all the time their Investigators were separated,
> and about how they managed to find each other again.
> The Keeper should take over the role(s)
> of as many of the remaining young people as they want
> during this conversation,
> and should make notes about those stories
> to use them later during the adventure
> whenever possible
> (More information for the Keeper is given
> in the **Keeper Knowledge** appendices)

Suddenly the sound of the sea changes.
It gets much softer and even quieter.
The continuous sounds of the waves start to reverb.
Looking at the sea,
the Orphans see the water first slowly getting blurry,
then a thick and smooth white fog
emitted from the water surface
and covers it so tightly
that it follows every movement of the water, every wave

The fog flows back and forth with the waves
when they hit the beach,
but every time a bit more of the fog stays on land
and drains down into the sand.
The young people feel the sand below their feet
becoming slowly softer.
They feel like walking on finest pillows,
or like in a sea of blossoms from magical flowers

And then each of them realizes
that this is not the first time,
that every one of them has seen that fog before,
when they were very young,
when their parents were still alive.
They realize that it was no dream
as they had thought for all those years,
and they start to remember...

> At this point, the Keeper explains the so-called
> **FlashBack Mechanics (FBM)** of this adventure,
> in which sanity checks decide
> how much of the past is revealed in those FlashBacks.
> The more sanity is lost,
> the more is revealed.
> The player(s) also tell about
> their own aspects of those memories.
> The Keeper makes again notes about these
> to use them later during the adventure
> whenever possible
