_\[TOTO\]_ Heavy revising!!!

* The head of a smuggling organization in Gdańsk,
  which secretly imports Swedish medicines to Poland,
  where health-care is badly organized
  and has to struggle with constant shortages in medication supply
  from the Soviet Union.
  The smuggle is supported by Jelka's Jewish contacts
  in the Swedish pharmaceutical industry.
* Jelka has a very broad knowledge and speeks several languages,
  which she learned from her father,
  a Jewish Austro-Slovakian World War I deserter from Bratislava,
  who was a pharmacist, anarchist, and member of the Esperanto movement.
  On his escape from the Austrian army jurisdiction,
  he eventually found shelter in the Jewish community
  of the Free City of Gdańsk,
  where he met Jelka's mother
  and took the opportunity to run a pharmacy
  after the retirement of its former owner
  and fellow Jewish community member.
* During the Nazi occupation of Gdańsk,
  Jelka and her father found shelter in different Jewish-friendly families,
  until her father was eventually arrested by Gestapo.
  Luckily she wasn't found and continued to find several hideouts.
* In the middle of World War II,
  Jelka joined the Polish resistance,
  where she used the chemical knowledge she gained from her father
  to become an explosives specialist.
  After becoming a member of Radek's resistance group,
  she quickly fell in love with him,
  but was soon afterwards besides Radek the only survivor
  of an attack on the group
  that Radek had not seen coming due to being drunk.
* Jelka still loves Radek,
  but could never forgive him the loss of their resistance group members.
  Therefore they haven't seen or talked to each other for a long time.
  Now Radek asks her to join the investigation of Torpedownia,
  because he feels that she is the only one
  who might believe him what happened to the young people at the beach.
  He also hopes that she will realize how much he truly regrets
  his failures of the past,
  and that he seeks a final salvation
  by rescuing those stolen young people
  and facing the mysterious forces
  that have haunted him in his dreams for most of his life.
