_\[TOTO\]_ Heavy revising!!!

* A retired World War I veteran from a small village near Kraków (Cracow),
  who was forced as a young man to join the Russian army.
  He was the only survivor on an unspecified minor battlefield
  in the end phase of the war in Eastern Europe.
  During an exceptionally dark night,
  all other soldiers on Russian side were killed
  by German artillery and a gas attack.
  While Radek tried to escape the battlefield,
  suddenly all gas got strangely soaked up by the ground
  and all German soldiers got mysteriously killed and taken away
  by a giant alien creature,
  which left recurring horror visions in Radek's mind
  for most of his life.
* After finding out that he lost his parents to the war when coming home,
  Radek soon moved to Gdynia to help building the new Polish Baltic Sea port,
  started a family and stayed there.
* Radek joined the Polish resistance in World War II after having lost
  his wife and all his three children to the war.
  There he met Jelka, a young woman with exceptional intellect
  and huge knowledge in chemistry,
  which had made her become an explosives specialist.
  Soon after she joined his resistance group
  they got attacked one night by Gestapo.
  Radek was drunk and therefore didn't see them coming.
  Only Jelka and Radek survived
  but couldn't deal each with other anymore
  due to his lethal failure.
* Radek is a man of action, who is almost fearless after having endured
  an unimaginable fright when whitnessing
  the horrifying incident on the battlefield.
  But he got lazy in his old days due to the increasing amount of alcohol
  he consumes to drown his torturing emotions
  about the cruel deaths of all his loved ones and fellows in his life.
* Radek is very skilled and telented in various handcrafts,
  able to repair virtually any machine and to improve tools and vehicles
  for special purposes.
* Now an old and desperate man,
  Radek whitnesses the alien creature coming back
  to snatch away a group of young people into the Baltic Sea at night.
  He is able to save young woman Gosia during the incident.
  After a few days of almost unbearable horror visions
  he agrees to Gosia's plan of investigating
  what is going on in the abandoned military sea platform Torpedownia,
  from where she heard the voices of her friends when revisiting the beach.
