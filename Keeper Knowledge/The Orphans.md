_\[TOTO\]_ Heavy revising!!!

* A medicine student from Gdynia,
  who is the only one of a group of young people
  that can be saved by Radek
  when he whitnesses the group getting mysteriously dragged
  by an alien creature into the Baltic Sea
  during the night at Babie Doły beach.
* Gosia lost her mother during a similar event when she was a child
  and alone with her at Orłowo beach at night,
  happy that the war was over,
  cherishing their survival and their hope for a better future.
  She saw a cat and wanted to play with it.
  When she ran after the cat and a little away from the beach,
  the same fog suddenly appeared.
  Her mother was as fascinated as Gosia's present friends
  by the strange event
  and was eventually also dragged into the sea like them.
  Nodoby wanted to believe Gosia's story about what she had seen.
  The event was offically declared as a suicide by the police.
  Gosia grew up alone then with her father,
  and as the years went by, the memories of her mother
  and the tragedy of her mother's disappearance
  became more and more just nothing but an old childhood dream.
* Gosia is a brave young woman with straight goals her life.
  She has already lots of practical experience as a physician assistant,
  is therefore able to treat many injuries,
  and has a good sense for recognizing probable threats to health.
* After the incident of her stolen friends,
  all memories about her mother come back.
  Gosia realizes that it was caused by the same mysterious force.
  She decides to fight back.
  After a few days she returns to Babie Doły beach at night
  and suddenly hears the voices of her friends,
  seeming to come from Torpedownia.
  She convinces Radek to investigate the incident together with her
  and reveal the mystery about what is going on
  in the abandoned military sea platform.
